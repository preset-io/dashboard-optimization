# The Data Engineer's Guide to Lightning-Fast Apache Superset Dashboards

One of the most common complaints people have after using a business intelligence (BI) tool for a while is that ‚Äúdashboards are slow‚Äù. No matter how beautiful and well constructed a dashboard is, or how well presented the information is, if the charts take minutes to load the dashboard becomes useless. In fact, according to research conducted by IBM in the 60s, human users become impatient if they have to wait more than œÄ (3.14) seconds for a response from an interactive computer system ‚Äî a unit jokingly described as a *nanocentury*.

How can we achieve those speeds? Is it really possible to make dashboards load in less than four seconds when we‚Äôre looking at metrics computed from millions or billions of rows? To understand how we can obtain those results, first let‚Äôs take a look at the lifecycle of a dashboard, starting from the initial SQL queries that power charts.

# The lifecycle of a dashboard

Data visualization usually starts with an *exploratory phase*, where the user is still unsure of what information they want to present. Imagine a table `orders` with records of all the products sold by a given company. A data analyst might start by looking at the overall volume of sales by running the following query:

```sql
SELECT SUM(totalprice) AS sales FROM orders;
```

The query above is a good start, but it‚Äôs a very top-level view of the metric. It doesn‚Äôt even tell us if sales are going up or down, so we might want to create a timeseries to look at trends in the metric:

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('day', orderdate) AS order_day,
  SUM(totalprice) AS sales,
  COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

This new query now gives us two daily metrics: the total value of sales, and the number of sales. But while more useful than the first query, this second query is still not very *actionable*. If sales are trending up or down we will probably want to understand why that is happening ‚Äî is it a particular country, a specific interface (Android, for example), an age bracket? Being able to slice-and-dice the metrics across multiple dimensions will allow us a better understanding of what‚Äôs going on in our business.

We can do that by bringing in some additional dimensions to the query:

```sql
SELECT
  -- dimensions:
  DATE_TRUNC('day', orderdate) AS order_day,
  customer.mktsegment,
  nation.name AS country,
  -- metrics:
  SUM(totalprice) AS sales,
  COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM orders
JOIN customer ON orders.custkey = customer.custkey
JOIN nation ON customer.nationkey = nation.nationkey
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 1;
```

The query above is much better: it has a couple metrics (`sales`, `cnt`) and a few dimensions (`order_day`, `mktsegment`, `country`), allowing us to build a dashboard that shows the metrics over time and by each of the selected dimensions. In the real world we might want to bring in even more metrics and dimensions, since we would try to anticipate the needs of anyone using the dataset in the near future. In fact, it‚Äôs not uncommon to have denormalized tables with hundreds of columns, for this exact reason.

<aside>
üí° Note that metrics are aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`), while dimensions are columns present in the `GROUP BY` (and, as such, should have low cardinality).

</aside>

Let‚Äôs prepare the data so we can build an Apache Superset dashboard where users can slice-and-dice the sales data.

# Building the dashboard

In order to build the dashboard we should first have some data. In this blog post we‚Äôre going to use Trino as a virtual data warehouse. We can spin it up very quickly using this minimal `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.9"
services:
  trino:
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    image: "trinodb/trino:455"
    volumes:
      - ./docker/trino/etc:/usr/lib/trino/etc:ro
      - ./docker/trino/catalog:/etc/trino/catalog
```

(All the files used in this blog post are available in the repository https://github.com/preset-io/dashboard-optimization.)

We can start it with:

```bash
docker compose up
```

To connect Superset to it we use the following SQLAlchemy URI:

```
trino://user@localhost:8080/tpch
```

Note that we‚Äôre connecting to the `tpch` catalog, from the [TPC-H benchmark](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/) ‚Äî a standard benchmark for decision support systems and includes several tables that model a simplified business scenario. The catalog has multiple schemas of increasing size: the `sf1` (scale factor 1) schema represents approximately 1GB of data, while the `sf1000` schema has the same tables with approximately 1000x more data (with the exception of the `nation` and `region` tables). The data is synthetic and generated on the fly.

In this blog post we‚Äôll use the `sf100` schema, since it has enough data so that performance becomes a problem, but not too much so we can still run in a personal laptop. Anyone following along can adjust the schema, depending on the computational power of their systems.

## Creating a dataset

To build charts from the metrics and dimensions above we can create a virtual dataset in Superset. The virtual dataset will perform the join between the fact table and the dimension tables, and we can later add the metrics as SQL expressions to it. This way there are no aggregations in the SQL of the virtual dataset, since they are performed by Superset‚Äôs chart builder.

Here is how the query definition looks like for a dataset called `orders_by_market_nation`:

![Screenshot 2024-10-17 at 16-23-34 Superset.png](images/Screenshot_2024-10-17_at_16-23-34_Superset.png)

And the metrics (`COUNT(*)` is the default metric, so we only need to add `total_sales`):

![Screenshot 2024-10-17 at 16-26-45 Superset.png](images/Screenshot_2024-10-17_at_16-26-45_Superset.png)

## Creating the chart

Now that we have our data, let‚Äôs build a timeseries of quarterly sales. We can do that by simply drag-n-dropping the `total_sales` metric we created, and setting the X axis to `order_date`, with a Time Grain of ‚ÄúQuarter‚Äù:

![Screenshot 2024-10-17 at 16-54-42 Superset.png](images/Screenshot_2024-10-17_at_16-54-42_Superset.png)

The chart doesn‚Äôt look very interesting because the data is synthetic. The important thing to notice is that the query took more than 45 seconds to run, very close to the default timeout limit of 1 minute that Superset has. If our datasets were slightly bigger (using the `sf1000` schema instead of the `sf100` schema, for example), the chart would definitely timeout. Even in the `sf100` schema, if we build a dashboard that loads multiple charts from this dataset it will likely result in timeouts.

# Improving performance

How can we make our chart load faster? Let‚Äôs look at a few common strategies for improving the performance of queries to make dashboards faster, as well as their pros and cons.

## Caching

Superset implements its own caching layer, and by default it caches queries for 1 day. A different timeout can be specified at the database, schema, dataset, or chart level. Caching is a simple and efficient solution: once cached in Redis, the chart above that takes 45 seconds to load can be generated in 0.09 seconds ‚Äî that‚Äôs 90 milliseconds, a 500x improvement! This must be the best solution for faster dashboards, right?

![Database configuration, showing options related to performance, including different cache timeouts.](images/Screenshot_2024-10-17_at_19-15-45_Superset.png)

Database configuration, showing options related to performance, including different cache timeouts.

Well, not so fast (no pun intended). The following day, once the cache has expired, the chart will still take 45 seconds to load and, because the cache is not SQL-aware, queries with an additional filter will not hit the cache. For example, if somebody wants to look at sales only in Brazil, the chart will have to run the full query with the additional predicate, even though in theory the new results could be computed from the cache data.

And while dashboards have repeatable and predictable query patterns, Superset dashboards are very interactive, with additional dynamic filters that can be applied across multiple charts, as well as allowing users to drill-down the results or vary the time window. This interactivity results in ad-hoc queries that will more likely result in cache misses, making caches useful only for dashboards where the data is in the presentation stage ‚Äî for example, a wall-mounted screen showing well-defined company metrics.

## Sampling

Sampling is a technique were only a subset of the data is used for a query. It‚Äôs useful when only an approximate result is needed since, unless the data is completely homogeneous, sampling will introduce errors in the metrics.

To create a chart with sampling, first let‚Äôs create another virtual dataset, called `orders_by_market_nation_sampled`. The dataset will be defined by the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  orders.totalprice,
  orders.orderdate,
  customer.mktsegment,
  nation.name AS nation_name
FROM orders TABLESAMPLE BERNOULLI (10)
JOIN customer TABLESAMPLE BERNOULLI (10) ON orders.custkey = customer.custkey
JOIN nation ON customer.nationkey = nation.nationkey
```

Here where using the `TABLESAMPLE` clause, using the `BERNOULLI` method to randomly select approximately 10% of the rows from the `orders` and `customer` tables. A lower percentage can be used for faster, but less accurate, results.

Because of the sampling on both sides of the first `JOIN` the query should use 1% of the data, compared to the unsampled query. Note that applying sampling to joined tables independently (as we did here) means that some rows might not find their matching pairs after the join. This could potentially skew your results, especially for less common join keys.

Another important thing to consider is that additive metrics, like `total_sales`, need to be scaled accordingly. In this case, both metrics in the sampled dataset need to be multiplied by 100:

![Screenshot 2024-10-17 at 19-25-47 Superset.png](images/Screenshot_2024-10-17_at_19-25-47_Superset.png)

When can now generate the same chart for the sampled dataset:

![Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 09-22-22 Superset.png](images/Screenshot_2024-10-18_at_09-22-22_Superset.png)

The results are not very impressive, to be honest: there‚Äôs much more noise in the metric (the standard deviation is much higher), and the chart is only approximately 3x faster, loading in 16 seconds. Nevertheless, sampling would bring the chart loading time away from the 1 minute default limit, making it much less likely to timeout at peak times. So, if approximate results are OK, this is a quick and easy solution that will help in many cases ‚Äî even if not approved by the IBM research team.

## Precomputing aggregations

One problem with all the solutions above is that the queries they need to run are highly inefficient.

The chart we created shows a timeseries of quarterly sales. Even if a cache is being used, every day that the dashboard is loaded it will trigger a query that computes sales for all quarters, including those that have already ended. In theory only the last quarter would need to be recomputed every day, until a new quarter starts. This will be the case for most metrics computed from fact tables, unless there is an error or change in business logic that requires backfilling the data.

A simple solution that benefits from this behavior is precomputing aggregations: metrics can be precomputed on a daily basis, as new data lands in the warehouse. This can be done using a scheduler like Apache Airflow, Dagster, or Prefect, with the results being stored in summary tables, either in the original warehouse or in a separate database. Even an OLTP database like Postgres and MariaDB could be used, since the volume of data is considerable smaller.

For this example, let‚Äôs use Postgres. We can add the following section to the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml

  postgres:
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    image: postgres:11
    container_name: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: trino
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: trino
    volumes:
      - ./docker/postgres/init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
```

Once we have Postgres up and running we can configure our scheduler to run the following query every day:

```sql
SELECT
  DATE(orders.orderdate) AS order_date,
  customer.mktsegment,
  nation.name AS nation_name,
  COUNT(*) AS order_count,
  SUM(orders.totalprice) AS total_price
FROM orders
JOIN customer ON orders.custkey = customer.custkey
JOIN nation ON customer.nationkey = nation.nationkey
WHERE DATE(orders.orderdate) = :target_date
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
```

Here, `:target_date`  is a variable representing a given day. The metrics for each day will be computed by the query above and stored in a summary table, which in this example will be created in Postgres by the file `init.sql` inside `docker/postgres/init/`:

```sql
-- docker/postgres/init/init.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS daily_order_summary (
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    mktsegment VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    nation_name VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
    order_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
    total_price DECIMAL(15, 2) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_date, mktsegment, nation_name)
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_daily_order_summary_date ON daily_order_summary (order_date);
```

How we run the query depends on the scheduler we want to use. In this blog post we‚Äôll be using a simple Python script that is idempotent. The script takes a given day as a parameter, for example `2024-01-01`, and runs the query for that day and stores the results in the summary table. This allows us to run the script in parallel for multiple days, and if any given day fails it can just be restarted independently. Here‚Äôs the `compute-summary.py` Python script that does that:

```python
"""
Compute daily aggregates.

This Python script serves as a "poorperson's ETL" pipeline. It reads data from a Trino
database for a given day, computes daily aggregates, and writes the results to a
PostgreSQL database.

The script is idempotent. Run as:

    python compute-summary.py YYYY-MM-DD

```

The script runs the query in Trino, stores the results in a Pandas dataframe, and later inserts the results into the summary table in Postgres. Note that in our example we could simplify the logic by connecting Trino directly to Postgres in a new catalog, and running an `INSERT INTO ... FROM SELECT ...` query, but the script above is a more generic solution, suitable for when two separate databases are used.

We can run the Python script using a bash script that parallelizes the calls, retrying for a number of times if a day falls. This is a hacky approach to running a proper scheduler, and should not be used in production. But for the sake of example only, here‚Äôs our `backfill-parallel.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

PARALLEL_JOBS=4
MAX_RETRIES=3
COMMAND="python compute-summary.py"

# Start and end dates
START_DATE="1992-01-01"
END_DATE="1998-08-02"

# Create a function that retries the command if it fails
run_command() {
    local date=$1
    local retries=0

    while [ $retries -lt $MAX_RETRIES ]; do
        echo "Running command: $COMMAND $date (Attempt: $((retries + 1)))"
        $COMMAND $date

        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Command succeeded: $COMMAND $date"
            return 0
        else
            echo "Command failed: $COMMAND $date. Retrying..."
            retries=$((retries + 1))
        fi
    done

    echo "Command failed after $MAX_RETRIES retries: $COMMAND $date"
    return 1
}

export -f run_command
export COMMAND MAX_RETRIES

# Generate all dates between START_DATE and END_DATE
seq_dates() {
    local current_date=$START_DATE
    local end_date=$END_DATE

    while [ "$current_date" != "$end_date" ]; do
        echo $current_date
        current_date=$(date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d" -v+1d "$current_date" "+%Y-%m-%d")
    done
    echo $end_date
}

# Use GNU parallel to run the commands in parallel
seq_dates | parallel -j $PARALLEL_JOBS run_command {}
```

After running the backfill script we can create a *physical* dataset pointing to it in Superset. This is one of the reasons why it‚Äôs important to anticipate needs and bring in as many metrics and dimensions as possible: adding new columns later requires changing the schema of the summary table, and backfilling the data (which might not be trivial to do for just a single column).

One important thing to notice here is that, because the data is pre-aggregated on a daily basis, special attention is needed when defining the metrics. The `order_count` column in the summary table is a pre-aggregation computed as `COUNT(*)`, so to compute the total number of orders we need to define a metric expressed by `SUM(order_count)`, that expresses the *sum* of the number of orders in each day.

Here are the metric definitions in the physical dataset:

![Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 08-20-57 Superset.png](images/Screenshot_2024-10-18_at_08-20-57_Superset.png)

Another caveat is that this solution only works with solutions that can be aggregated linearly, like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, etc. Special attention is needed for metrics like `COUNT DISTINCT`: if we compute a daily `COUNT DISTINCT` we can‚Äôt simply sum the values to get a monthly value, since that would very likely over count values. Trino offers a solution based on `HyperLogLog`, where the pre-aggregation is done using the `approx_set` function:

```sql
CREATE TABLE daily_summary AS
SELECT
  date_trunc('day', timestamp) AS day,
  approx_set(user_id) AS daily_distinct_users
FROM events
GROUP BY 1
```

And later we can query at the monthly grain, for example, using the `cardinality` and `merge` functions:

```sql
SELECT
  date_trunc('month', day) AS month,
  cardinality(merge(daily_distinct_users)) AS monthly_distinct_users
FROM daily_summary
GROUP BY 1
```

This is, as the name suggests, an *approximate* solution.

How does performance look querying our summary table? Here‚Äôs a chart built on the physical dataset:

![Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 08-35-25 Superset.png](images/Screenshot_2024-10-18_at_08-35-25_Superset.png)

The chart is identical to the initial one, that queried Trino directly, but it only took 0.56 seconds to render ‚Äî an 80x improvement! Other variations of the query are equally fast: we can filter by a specific country and group by only the market segment, for example, and the chart will still render under a second. All it required was some planning and a scheduler.

## Other solutions

There are many other common solutions that can be used to make dashboards faster, and this blog post assumes they‚Äôre already in place. The first thing that should be considered is query optimization: are the proper indexes in place, is it possible to avoid expensive joins, are predicates pushed down to inner queries?

Another simple (but costly) solution is to scale vertically, by upgrading the database hardware with more CPU and memory, as well as faster disks (as well as adjusting parameters like buffer pool size, query cache, and connection limits to make better use of the increased resources).

Scaling horizontally can be another possible solution, when the data can be sharded across multiple database servers. Even adding read-replicas of the database might help, if many clients are accessing the data concurrently. Also consider using a distributed database system that Superset supports, like ClickHouse, Druid, Pinot.

Many modern data warehouses support materialized views, which can precompute and store query results. This is another potential solution that can significantly speed up repetitive queries without moving data to a separate system.

## Conclusion

In blog post we explored a spectrum of optimization techniques to make dashboards faster, each with its own strengths and trade-offs. From simple caching to orchestrating the precomputation of aggregations, the path to more performant dashboards is one of trade-offs.

While caching offers quick wins for static dashboards, it falls short for highly interactive scenarios. Sampling provides a balance between speed and accuracy, albeit with some compromises in data precision. Precomputing aggregations emerges as a powerful solution, dramatically reducing query times while maintaining data integrity, though it requires more upfront planning and ongoing maintenance.

As we've seen, there's no one-size-fits-all approach; the best solution often involves a combination of techniques tailored to your specific use case, data volume, and user needs. Remember, the goal isn't just to make dashboards faster, but to create a seamless, responsive experience that empowers all users in the organization to derive insights quickly and effortlessly.
